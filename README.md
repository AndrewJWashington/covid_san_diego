# covid\_san\_diego
Originally, I just wanted to make a plot that I felt was missing from [San Diego County's Covid-19 webpage](https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/hhsa/programs/phs/community_epidemiology/dc/2019-nCoV/status.html). This then piqued my interest and I ended up estimating the actual number of cases in San Diego County. Then I expanded to the rest of the state. Most of the commentary is now out of date, but you can see an updated version of the notebook without commentary [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AndrewJWashington/covid_san_diego/master?filepath=california_automated_update.ipynb).
  
Feel free to contact me for any questions or concerns. I'd be interested in a conversation around the topic.
