Originally, I just wanted to make a plot that I felt was missing from [San Diego County's Covid-19 webpage](https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/hhsa/programs/phs/community_epidemiology/dc/2019-nCoV/status.html). This then piqued my interest and I ended up estimating the actual number of cases in San Diego County. Interestingly enough, it seems that the number of cases was going down for some time, but started increasing again. Recently, we seem to have been leveling off, but only time will tell.  
  
Feel free to contact me for any questions or concerns. I'd be interested in a conversation around the topic.
